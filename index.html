                <p class="about-me-paragraph">My name is Adrian, I live in Sydney, NSW Australia. I have created this portfolio to showcase my current and upcoming
                    skills as well as deployed applications. I would like to become an excellent and skilled programmer as I believe
                    this would help me in my life. My main goal as a Web Developer is to be able to make some sort of change
                    in the world as well as make some pretty awesome websites that can be used for generations to come.</p>
